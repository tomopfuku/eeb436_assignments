    "This week, you will learn about how to program with (pseudo-) randomness to generate frequency distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we will need to import the `random` module in order to generate some stochasticity. `random` contains many useful functions for generating different sorts of random values and randomly subsampling data structures, but we will try to restrict our use to `random.random()`. This particular function will generate a pseudorandom floating point number between zero and 1. The reason for this is that most of the additional functions in Python's `random` module are simply \"wrappers\" for `random.random()`, which means that they use it to perform another operation (in a way that is usually pretty simple). Since one goal of this course is to learn how to think like a programmer, we will simply use `random.random()` as-is to do this work ourselves."

Alternatively, there are approaches that do not require that you alter the list of dinner options."
