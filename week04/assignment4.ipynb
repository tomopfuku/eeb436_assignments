    "We will deal with the simplest case where there are two tree species and focus on just a small area of the forest. Let **T1** and **T2** be the densities of the adults of the two species. To begin with, suppose no one has sampled this area of the forest and there don't know the exact densities. However, data from other parts of the forest suggest that the density of the each tree species is distributed approximately normally. However, it would not make sense for a density of trees to be negative. Further, the patch can only support densities upto K = 20. K is called the carrying capacity of the patch. Therefore, each seed are distributed according to a truncated normal distribution with values between 0 and 10. \n",
