    "We will deal with the simplest case where there are two tree species and focus on just a small area of the forest. Let **T1** and **T2** be the densities of the adults of the two species. To begin with, suppose no one has sampled this area of the forest and so we don't know the exact densities. However, data from other parts of the forest suggest that the density of the each tree species is distributed approximately normally. However, it would not make sense for a density of trees to be negative. Further, the patch can only support densities upto K = 20. K is called the carrying capacity of the patch. To start, we will assume that each species can occupy only half of the carrying capacity. Therefore, each species is distributed according to a truncated normal distribution with values between 0 and 10.\n",

    "The model might be a decent starting point to get some idea of how the densities of species 1 and 2 might vary, but we can make thinigs a little bit more realistic. In problem 1, we set things up so that the densities of species 1 and species 2 independent of one another. In reality, we might expect there to be some dependency between the two. Let's try to include this in our model. From Hubbell (1979), we learned that the tree species in a forest tend to be distributed in a way where several \"common\" species occur at high abundance, while other \"rare\" species occur at low abundance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume for now that the abundance of common species tends to be stable. Create a new `trunc_normal` distribution with a mean (of the underlying normal distribution) of 15 and standard deviation of 2 and assign it to the variable `T1` like we did before. Like before, we will set the lower boundary to be zero, but this time we will increase the upper boundary to be 20, which the same as our carrying capacity,  _K_. This means that species 1 may range from having zero individuals in the community to encompassing the entire community. Instantiate a seecond truncated normal distribution to represent the distribution of abundances for species 2. Set the standard deviation to 4 and the lower bound to zero. The other two parameters, the mean and upper boundary can be set to any arbitrary values to start. "

Loop over the T1 samples, and each time, reset the T2 mean and upper bound (b) to reflect its dependence on T1. Since we know that _K_ = 20 and that the community cannot exceed this value in size, that means that T2 can only fill in whatever empty space is left by T1. As such, a sample for T2 can never exceed $K - T1$. We might also expect that, most of the time, the two tree species tend to fill all of the available space and so the mean of T2 is also equal to this upper bound. For each iteration of the loop over the T1 samples, update the mean and upper bound attributes for T2 to reflect this. After updating the attributes, draw a single sample from T2 and append it to a list.

    "In this scenario each tree produces on average $r=1$ seed. There are no tree specific herbivores, so the survival of these seeds only depends on competition with other seeds of the same species in the region. Therefore, we get that the density of seeds of species 1 is distributed according to a truncated normal with the mean of the underlying normal distribution $r*T1*(1 - \\displaystyle \\frac{r*T1}{K})$ and variance $2$ and the limits being 0 and 10. Similarly, the seed density of species 2 is truncated normal but with mean $r*T2*(1 - \\displaystyle \\frac{r*T2}{K})$. We will want to keep the same dependency between _T1_ and _T2_ as we had in the previous step.\n",

    "To model seed densities under this scenario, sample 10000 pairs of values for T1 and T2. Remember that the parameters for _T2_ for any given replicate are dependent on the value of _T1_, so you will need to simulate both as you did in the previous question. For each pair of T1 and T2, sample 10 values of the corresponding seed distributions. Collect these values in two lists (one for each species). Therefore, you will have 10000x10 = 100000 sample values for each of the seed distributions. In the same plot,  plot a histogram witn 100 bins for the two distributions of seed densitites. **(2 pt)**\n",

In each iteration sample one value for T2 after updating its parameters according to the corresponding value of T1. So for example, if you are on iteration 10, base the parameters for T2 on `T1_samples[9]`. Use these T1 and T2 samples to initiate the seed distributions S1 and S2 based on the equation above and sample 10 values of each and store them in separate list. \n",
